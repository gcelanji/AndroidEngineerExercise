# AndroidEngineerExercise - Description
The aim of this exercise is to build the following Android app with a simple home screen and user registration screen.

We have provided the required font and image files to build the app, and a PDF file with an overview of the screens and the various validation states for the form. You should focus mainly on implementing the functionality though - we are not expecting a pixel perfect replication of the designs. Imagine that this is part of a larger application - maintainability and reusability is important.
You must:
• validate that emails and passwords are in a valid format
• validate that passwords match
• enable the ‘Next’ button once form is valid
• mock the registration process by persisting users locally (use any technology you like to do this).
The registration form should subsequently recognise if an email address is not available and notify the user.
Additionally, the project must:
• target Android Marshmallow and above
• compile without any errors or warnings
